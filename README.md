# This is all just stuff that I work on in class, personal projects, and general coding/hacking for practice 

I'm the president of the cyber security club at CSUDH and a Computer Tech major with an associates in Cyber Security, over the years I've slowly built up a large amount of coding projects from code academy/school and hacking projects from HackTheBox/my club. 

This repo is going to be a compilation, cornucopia, compendium of all the things I've worked on during this time.
